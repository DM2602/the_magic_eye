# the_magic_eye
Magic eye is a bot for detecting image reposts in subreddits, as well as managing moderator tasks around reposted images.

###Clear 

You can reply to Magic Eye with "clear" to clear the history for an image.
 
* Use clear if you change your mind on a previous post
* Use clear if the previous image is deleted and no longer makes a good reference
* **DON'T** use clear if it's a false positive, just approve it. The bot will shortly detect that it was wrong and avoid the mistake in the future

Note to self about postgres:

use databse: \c the_magic_eye
