test plan

#normal processing

* ignores not png/jpg (i.e. text)
* removes + distinguished broken images
* removes images that are too small
* remove repost



#mod processing tool

* ignore RepostSentinel / Automoderator

* ignore posts where mod left no comment
* mod deals with repost manually, should ignore and log
* read a mod comment with multiple bullet points
* mark + remove blacklisted image (done as normal, but requires modlog read)
* mark + approve previously approved post

#inbox processing

* clear command - make sure it deletes
* dms - see what it does

can use [](#magic_ignore), reposts do this automatically
